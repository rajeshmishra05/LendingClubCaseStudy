# Lending club case study

## Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to identify risky loan applicants and reduce credit loss by understanding the driving factors behind loan default. The focus is on customers labeled as 'charged-off' (defaulters).

## Steps Involved
1. **Load and Prepare Data:** Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, converting data types, and removing outliers.
2. **Visualize Key Distributions:** Generate histograms and count plots for key variables such as loan amount, interest rates, annual income, and loan status.
3. **Bivariate Analysis:** Analyze relationships between pairs of variables, particularly focusing on their impact on loan default.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Create a correlation matrix to understand the relationships between key variables and loan status.
5. **Identify Key Variables Affecting Loan Default:** Determine which variables are strong indicators of default.
6. **Summarize Insights and Recommendations:** Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Key Findings
- Higher interest rates are associated with higher default rates.
- Larger loan amounts are positively correlated with defaults.
- Lower annual incomes are associated with higher default rates.
- Higher debt-to-income ratios are associated with greater risk of default.

## Recommendations
- Focus on applicants with lower interest rates to reduce the risk of default.
- Consider setting limits on loan amounts based on the applicant's financial stability.
- Prioritize applicants with higher annual incomes to minimize default risk.
- Pay attention to the debt-to-income ratio when evaluating loan applications.

## Files Included
